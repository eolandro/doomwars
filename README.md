# Doom wars
## This is a repo of Doom Wars 
Doom wars is a work of cybermind aka Mistranger.
I want to keep Doom Wars playable. I'm a developer but not game developer, so expect the unexpected!!!.

eolandro.
PD. sorry for bad english.

here are some changes:

+ All sounds and graphics had lowercase name. (it's better for unix like)
+ Changed from CanGroundAttack to GroundAttack.
+ It must be run with stratagus v2.4.2 ( that was my test)
+ Runs in debian 9 and debian Testing.
